This project implements a deep learning framework to predict drug side effects using various datasets and neural network models.

üîó GitHub Repo: [DeepSide on GitHub](https://github.com/druvath-09/deepside_deeplearning_approach_to_predict-_side_effect_prediction)

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `deepSide/` - Main application logic and model files
- `Database/` - Contains drug-related datasets
- `venv/` - Virtual environment (should be ignored by Git)
- `Datastructure.txt` - Describes the data structure used
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies


## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/druvath-09/deepside_deeplearning_approach_to_predict-_side_effect_prediction.git
   cd deepside_deeplearning_approach_to_predict-_side_effect_prediction
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate # On Linux/macOS

3. **Install dependencies:**

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Run the project:**

python manage.py runserver


Dependencies
Python 3.6+

Django

NumPy

Pandas
